			Keyboard
			Configure Keyboard
			by Guido Schimmels

Brief
~~~~~
Keyboard lets you change keyboard layout, keyboard shortcuts and text cursor
behaviour.

New versions can be found here:

	http://rox.sourceforge.net/desktop/Keyboard

You need to be running ROX-Session in order to use Keyboard. It is ROX-Session
that saves the settings and restores them when you next log in; Keyboard only
provides the graphical interface.

Most settings have a tooltip, so hover the mouse over one of them to get more
information.


Known issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The D-BUS developers dropped support for Python 2.3. Keyboard is therefore
hard-coded to use Python 2.4. If you have an even later version (e.g.,
Python 2.5) then you'll need to edit the first line of the AppRun file.

The keyboard LED settings don't appear to work.
